# Fri3d Badge 2024 + Mini-Blaster
# Sony IR Remote Control

I needed 2 remotes, one with 12-bit protocol and one with 15-bit protocol.
That just wouldn't do, so I want to make/program my own remote control.

## Todo
* Any kind of feedback when a button is pressed, so I know the badge is at least reacting
* Make run-time configurable, so we can adapt to any vendor?
* "learning" move, where remote can store any IR command
* GUI
